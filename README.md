- I'm currently under a bachelor's degree in Computer Science by the Federal University of Pernambuco ([@cin-ufpe](https://github.com/cin-ufpe)), But im also a certified Systems Developer by ETE Porto Digital.
- You can talk to me at: msnc@cin.ufpe.br;
- Currently Exploring Machine Learning and Mathematics to do some cool stuff, and i'm also proficient at Front-end Development with Next/React;
- Reading:

- I'm interested in diving into Deep Learning and For Computer Vision. Despite that, I love technology in general and I get along well with any area im genuinely interested;
- I learn best by doing. Most of my projects are idea i thought would be cool to bring to life.
